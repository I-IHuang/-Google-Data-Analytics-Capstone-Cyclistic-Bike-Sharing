## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning and Transformation

### Remove Duplicates, Blank and Null Values, Inconsistent Ride Durations, Invalid Ride IDs, and Exclude Electric Scooters

In this section, we will clean the dataset by addressing the following issues:
- **Duplicate Rows**: We remove duplicate records by selecting distinct entries based on the `ride_id`.
- **Blank and Null Values**: We remove rows where critical fields such as `start_station_id`, `end_station_name`, and `end_station_id` are `NULL` (missing or blank).
- **Inconsistent Ride Durations**: We filter out rides with durations that are too short (less than 1 minute) or too long (greater than 1440 minutes).
- **Invalid Ride IDs**: We ensure that `ride_id` consists of exactly 16 digits for consistency.
- **Exclude 'electric scooter' as a Rideable Type**: We filter out any records where `rideable_type = 'electric scooter'`.

### SQL Query:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Capstone_Bike.cleaned_ride_data` AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    -- **Ride ID** with length check (e.g., considering only 16 digits)
    ride_id,
    rideable_type,
    started_at,
    ended_at,
    member_casual,
    start_station_name,
    start_station_id,
    end_station_name,
    end_station_id,
    start_lat,
    start_lng,
    end_lat,
    end_lng,
    ride_duration,
  
    -- **Season Classification** based on month (Winter: Dec-Feb, Spring: Mar-May, Summer: Jun-Aug, Autumn: Sep-Nov)
    CASE
      WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM started_at) IN (12, 1, 2) THEN 'Winter'
      WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM started_at) IN (3, 4, 5) THEN 'Spring'
      WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM started_at) IN (6, 7, 8) THEN 'Summer'
      WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM started_at) IN (9, 10, 11) THEN 'Autumn'
    END AS season,

    -- **Month Name** (e.g., January, February) extracted from the `started_at` timestamp
    FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%B', started_at) AS month_name,

-- **Day Name** (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) extracted from the `started_at` timestamp    
    FORMAT_DATE('%A', DATE(started_at)) AS weekday_name,

    -- **Hour of the Day** (0-23) extracted from the `started_at` timestamp
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM started_at) AS hour,

    -- **Time of Day Buckets** based on the hour (Morning: 5-11, Afternoon: 12-16, Evening: 17-20, Night: Else)
    CASE
      WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM started_at) BETWEEN 5 AND 11 THEN 'Morning'
      WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM started_at) BETWEEN 12 AND 16 THEN 'Afternoon'
      WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM started_at) BETWEEN 17 AND 20 THEN 'Evening'
      ELSE 'Night'
    END AS time_of_day

  FROM (
    -- **Subquery**: Calculate ride duration and assign row numbers
    SELECT *,
           TIMESTAMP_DIFF(ended_at, started_at, MINUTE) AS ride_duration,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ride_id ORDER BY started_at) AS rn
    FROM `Capstone_Bike.complete_table`
  ) t

  -- Keep first row per **ride_id** only to eliminate duplicates
  WHERE rn = 1

  -- Keep only valid **ride durations** (between 1 minute and 1440 minutes)
  AND ride_duration BETWEEN 1 AND 1440

  -- Ensure key **location fields** are not null (important for accurate analysis)
  AND start_station_name IS NOT NULL
  AND start_station_id IS NOT NULL
  AND end_station_name IS NOT NULL
  AND end_station_id IS NOT NULL
  AND end_lat IS NOT NULL
  AND end_lng IS NOT NULL

  -- Optionally, filter or normalize **ride_id** lengths (e.g., only include 16-digit **ride_ids**)
  AND LENGTH(ride_id) = 16  -- Only include rows where the **ride_id** has exactly 16 digits

  AND rideable_type != 'electric scooter'
);
```
### Check Total Records/Rows after Cleaning

Optionally, check the row count: 4160427 rows returned, which means 1537877 rows were removed. 
```sql
SELECT COUNT(ride_id) AS no_of_rows FROM `Capstone_Bike.cleaned_ride_data`;
```
