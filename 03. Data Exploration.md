# Data Exploration Queries for Cyclistic Bike-Sharing Dataset

### 1. Data Types of Columns
This query retrieves the column names along with their corresponding data types in the complete_table dataset.

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM `Capstone_Bike.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
WHERE table_name = 'complete_table';
```

### 2. **Total Records/Rows** 
This query calculates the total number of records (rows) in the `complete_table` dataset.
```sql
SELECT count(*) as total_records 
FROM `Capstone_Bike.complete_table`;
```

### 3. Total Rides by Member Type
This query counts the total number of rides for each member_casual type (annual members or casual riders).
```sql
SELECT member_casual, count(*)
FROM `my-project-capstone-439505.Capstone_Bike.complete_table`
GROUP BY member_casual;
```

### 4. Duplicate Rows
This query checks for duplicate rows based on the `ride_id` column by comparing the total count of `ride_id` with the count of distinct `ride_id`.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(ride_id) - COUNT(DISTINCT ride_id) AS duplicate_rows
FROM `Capstone_Bike.1complete_table`;
```

### 5. Check ride_id Length
This query checks for duplicate rows based on the `ride_id` column by comparing the total count of `ride_id` with the count of distinct `ride_id`.
```sql
SELECT 
  length(ride_id) AS length_ride_id, 
  count(ride_id) AS no_of_rows
FROM `Capstone_Bike.complete_table`
GROUP BY length(ride_id);
```

### 6. Check Bike Type
This query checks the count of each type of bike used in the dataset, based on the `rideable_type` field.
```sql
SELECT 
  rideable_type, 
  count(rideable_type) AS no_of_rides
FROM `Capstone_Bike.complete_table`
GROUP BY rideable_type;
```

### 7. Outliers in Ride Duration
This query identifies rides that are unusually short (less than 1 minute) or unusually long (more than 24 hours) based on the difference between the started_at and ended_at timestamps.
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNTIF(TIMESTAMP_DIFF(ended_at, started_at, MINUTE) < 1) AS too_short_rides,
  COUNTIF(TIMESTAMP_DIFF(ended_at, started_at, HOUR) > 24) AS too_long_rides
FROM `Capstone_Bike.complete_table`;

```

### 8. Null Value Check for Columns
This query calculates the percentage of null values for several columns in the `complete_table` dataset.
```sql
SELECT 'ride_id' AS column_name, 
       concat(round((count(*) - count(ride_id)) / count(*) * 100, 2), '%') AS percentage
FROM `my-project-capstone-439505.Capstone_Bike.complete_table`

UNION ALL

SELECT 'rideable_type' AS column_name, 
       concat(round((count(*) - count(rideable_type)) / count(*) * 100, 2), '%') AS percentage
FROM `my-project-capstone-439505.Capstone_Bike.complete_table`

UNION ALL

SELECT 'started_at' AS column_name, 
       concat(round((count(*) - count(started_at)) / count(*) * 100, 2), '%') AS percentage
FROM `my-project-capstone-439505.Capstone_Bike.complete_table`

UNION ALL

SELECT 'ended_at' AS column_name, 
       concat(round((count(*) - count(ended_at)) / count(*) * 100, 2), '%') AS percentage

UNION ALL

SELECT 'start_station_id' AS column_name, 
       concat(round((count(*) - count(start_station_id)) / count(*) * 100, 2), '%') AS percentage
FROM `my-project-capstone-439505.Capstone_Bike.complete_table`

UNION ALL

SELECT 'end_station_name' AS column_name, 
       concat(round((count(*) - count(end_station_name)) / count(*) * 100, 2), '%') AS percentage
FROM `my-project-capstone-439505.Capstone_Bike.complete_table`

UNION ALL

SELECT 'end_station_id' AS column_name, 
       concat(round((count(*) - count(end_station_id)) / count(*) * 100, 2), '%') AS percentage
FROM `my-project-capstone-439505.Capstone_Bike.complete_table`

UNION ALL

SELECT 'start_lat' AS column_name, 
       concat(round((count(*) - count(start_lat)) / count(*) * 100, 2), '%') AS percentage

UNION ALL

SELECT 'start_lng' AS column_name, 
       concat(round((count(*) - count(start_lng)) / count(*) * 100, 2), '%') AS percentage

UNION ALL

SELECT 'end_lng' AS column_name, 
       concat(round((count(*) - count(end_lng)) / count(*) * 100, 2), '%') AS percentage

UNION ALL

SELECT 'member_casual' AS column_name, 
       concat(round((count(*) - count(member_casual)) / count(*) * 100, 2), '%') AS percentage
FROM `my-project-capstone-439505.Capstone_Bike.complete_table`;
```

### 9. Missing Values Check for Station Name and Coordinates

This query checks for missing values in various columns related to start and end station names, station IDs, and coordinates (latitude and longitude). 
It also looks for overlaps where both the station name and ID are missing or where both latitude and longitude are missing.

```sql
SELECT 'Missing Name or ID for Start Station' AS case_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table
WHERE start_station_id IS NULL OR start_station_name IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Missing Both Start Station Name & ID' AS case_type, COUNT(*)
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table
WHERE start_station_name IS NULL AND start_station_id IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Missing Name or ID for End Station' AS case_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table
WHERE end_station_id IS NULL OR end_station_name IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Missing Both End Station Name & ID' AS case_type, COUNT(*)
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table
WHERE end_station_name IS NULL AND end_station_id IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Missing Both End Latitude & Longitude' AS case_type, COUNT(*)
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table
WHERE end_lat IS NULL AND end_lng IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Missing Both Start Latitude & Longitude' AS case_type, COUNT(*)
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table
WHERE start_lat IS NULL AND start_lng IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Missing Start Latitude or Longitude' AS case_type, COUNT(*)
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table
WHERE start_lat IS NULL OR start_lng IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Missing End Latitude or Longitude' AS case_type, COUNT(*)
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table
WHERE end_lat IS NULL OR end_lng IS NULL;
```
### 10. Blank and Null Value Check

This query checks for blank (`''`) and null (`NULL`) values across various fields in the `Capstone_Bike.complete_table`. Blank values are represented as empty strings (`''`), while missing values for `TIMESTAMP` fields and coordinates are represented as `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT 'blank_count_ride_id' AS columname, COUNT(*) AS count_value 
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table 
WHERE ride_id = ''

UNION ALL

SELECT 'blank_count_rideable_type', COUNT(*) 
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table 
WHERE rideable_type =''

UNION ALL

SELECT 'null_count_started_at', COUNT(*) 
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table 
WHERE started_at IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'null_count_ended_at', COUNT(*) 
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table 
WHERE ended_at IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'blank_count_start_station_name', COUNT(*) 
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table 
WHERE start_station_name = ''

UNION ALL

SELECT 'blank_count_start_station_id', COUNT(*) 
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table 
WHERE start_station_id = ''

UNION ALL

SELECT 'blank_count_end_station_name', COUNT(*) 
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table 
WHERE end_station_name = ''

UNION ALL

SELECT 'blank_count_end_station_id', COUNT(*) 
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table 
WHERE end_station_id = ''

UNION ALL

SELECT 'null_count_start_lat', COUNT(*) 
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table 
WHERE start_lat IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'null_count_start_lng', COUNT(*) 
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table 
WHERE start_lng IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'null_count_end_lat', COUNT(*) 
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table 
WHERE end_lat IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'null_count_end_lng', COUNT(*) 
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table 
WHERE end_lng IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'blank_count_member_casual', COUNT(*) 
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table 
WHERE member_casual = '';
```
