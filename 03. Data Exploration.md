# Data Exploration Queries for Cyclistic Bike-Sharing Dataset

### 1. **Total Records/Rows** 
```sql
SELECT count(*) as total_records 
FROM `Capstone_Bike.complete_table`;
```

### 2. Data Types of Columns
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM `Capstone_Bike.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
WHERE table_name = 'complete_table';
```

### 3. Null Value Check for Columns

This query calculates the percentage of null values for several columns in the `complete_table` dataset.

```sql
SELECT 'ride_id' AS column_name, 
       concat(round((count(*) - count(ride_id)) / count(*) * 100, 2), '%') AS percentage

# Missing Values Check for Station Name and Coordinates

This query checks for missing values in various columns related to start and end station names, station IDs, and coordinates (latitude and longitude). 
It also looks for overlaps where both the station name and ID are missing or where both latitude and longitude are missing.

```sql
SELECT 'Missing Name or ID for Start Station' AS case_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table
WHERE start_station_id IS NULL OR start_station_name IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Missing Both Start Station Name & ID' AS case_type, COUNT(*)
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table
WHERE start_station_name IS NULL AND start_station_id IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Missing Name or ID for End Station' AS case_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table
WHERE end_station_id IS NULL OR end_station_name IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Missing Both End Station Name & ID' AS case_type, COUNT(*)
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table
WHERE end_station_name IS NULL AND end_station_id IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Missing Both End Latitude & Longitude' AS case_type, COUNT(*)
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table
WHERE end_lat IS NULL AND end_lng IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Missing Both Start Latitude & Longitude' AS case_type, COUNT(*)
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table
WHERE start_lat IS NULL AND start_lng IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Missing Start Latitude or Longitude' AS case_type, COUNT(*)
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table
WHERE start_lat IS NULL OR start_lng IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Missing End Latitude or Longitude' AS case_type, COUNT(*)
FROM Capstone_Bike.complete_table
WHERE end_lat IS NULL OR end_lng IS NULL;
```
