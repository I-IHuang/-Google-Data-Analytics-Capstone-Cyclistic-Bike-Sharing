# Cyclistic Case Study - Data Preparation and Analysis

This repository outlines the data preparation and analysis steps for Cyclistic's bike-sharing data. The goal is to consolidate multiple months of trip data into a single dataset, prepare the data for further analysis, and generate insights that help the marketing team convert casual riders into annual members.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preparation & Upload Process

Cyclistic‚Äôs trip data files for each month exceeded BigQuery's upload limit (100 MB). To handle this, each large file was split into two parts:

- A **main file** with core trip data (without station and coordinate info).
- A **station file** containing station names, IDs, and coordinates.

Both files retained the `ride_id` field as the primary key to allow future merging in BigQuery.

### To remove station-related columns and export a clean version for upload:

```powershell

$inputFile = "C:\...\202406-divvy-tripdata.csv"  # Path to your input CSV file
$outputFile = "C:\...\output.csv"  # Path to save the output

Write-Output "Starting the script..."

-- Check if the input file exists
if (Test-Path -Path $inputFile) {
    Write-Output "Input file found: $inputFile"
} else {
    Write-Output "Error: Input file not found at $inputFile"
    exit
}

-- Import the CSV file
$data = Import-Csv -Path $inputFile
Write-Output "Data imported successfully. Total rows: $($data.Count)"

# Define the columns you want to remove
$columnsToRemove = @("start_station_name", "start_station_id", "end_station_name", "end_station_id", "start_lat", "start_lng", "end_lat", "end_lng")
Write-Output "Columns to remove: $columnsToRemove"

-- Create a new array to hold the modified data
$modifiedData = @()

-- Loop through each row in the original data
Write-Output "Processing rows..."
foreach ($row in $data) {
    # Create a new PSObject for each row without the excluded columns
    $newRow = New-Object PSObject

    # Add properties to the new row, excluding the specified columns
    foreach ($property in $row.PSObject.Properties) {
        if ($property.Name -notin $columnsToRemove) {
            $newRow | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name $property.Name -Value $property.Value
        }
    }

    # Add the new row to the modified data array
    $modifiedData += $newRow
}

Write-Output "All rows processed. Preparing to export..."

-- Export the modified data to a new CSV file
$modifiedData | Export-Csv -Path $outputFile -NoTypeInformation

-- Confirm script completion
if (Test-Path -Path $outputFile) {
    Write-Output "Script completed successfully. Output file saved at: $outputFile"
} else {
    Write-Output "Error: Output file could not be created."
```
