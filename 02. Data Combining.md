## üóÉÔ∏è Data Combining in BigQuery

After the files were uploaded to BigQuery, they were combined into unified tables for further analysis. This process ensures that all the necessary information, such as ride details and station coordinates, is merged and ready for use.

### üìÅ Step 1: Create `combined_table` (Core Trip Data)

To consolidate the core trip data from each monthly file into one table, the following SQL query was used:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Capstone_Bike.combined_table` AS (
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202309_copy`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202310_copy`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202311_copy`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202312_copy`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202401_copy`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202402_copy`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202403_copy`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202404_copy`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202405_copy`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202406_copy`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202407_copy`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202408_copy`
);
