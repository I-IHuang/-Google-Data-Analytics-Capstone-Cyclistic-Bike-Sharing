## üóÉÔ∏è Data Combining in BigQuery

After the files were uploaded to BigQuery, they were combined into unified tables for further analysis. This process ensures that all the necessary information, such as ride details and station coordinates, is merged and ready for use.

### üìÅ Step 1: Create `combined_table` (Core Trip Data)

To consolidate the core trip data from each monthly file into one table, the following SQL query was used:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Capstone_Bike.combined_table` AS (
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202309`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202310`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202311`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202312`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202401`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202402`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202403`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202404`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202405`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202406`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202407`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual FROM `Capstone_Bike.202408`
);
```

### üìÅ Step 2: Create `combined_table1` (Station & Coordinates)

In this step, we consolidate the station and coordinates data from each monthly file into a single table. The data includes station names, station IDs, and coordinates for both start and end stations. This is important as it links the station information to the ride data.

#### SQL Query to Create `combined_table1`

The following SQL query is used to create the table `combined_table1` and consolidate the station-related data from all the monthly files:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Capstone_Bike.combined_table1` AS (
  SELECT ride_id, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id,
         start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual
  FROM `Capstone_Bike.202309_Station`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id,
         start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual
  FROM `Capstone_Bike.202310_Station`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id,
         start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual
  FROM `Capstone_Bike.202311_Station`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id,
         start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual
  FROM `Capstone_Bike.202312_Station`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id,
         start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual
  FROM `Capstone_Bike.202401_Station`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id,
         start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual
  FROM `Capstone_Bike.202402_Station`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id,
         start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual
  FROM `Capstone_Bike.202403_Station`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id,
         start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual
  FROM `Capstone_Bike.202404_Station`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id,
         start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual
  FROM `Capstone_Bike.202405_Station`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id,
         start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual
  FROM `Capstone_Bike.202406_Station`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id,
         start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual
  FROM `Capstone_Bike.202407_Station`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ride_id, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id,
         start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual
  FROM `Capstone_Bike.202408_Station`
);
```

### üìÅ Step 3: Join the Tables into `complete_table`

In this step, we join the two previously created tables ‚Äî `combined_table` (which contains the core trip data) and `combined_table1` (which contains the station and coordinates data) ‚Äî using the `ride_id` field as the primary key. This results in the creation of the `complete_table`, which combines both the trip and station details, making it ready for analysis.

#### SQL Query to Join the Tables

The following SQL query performs the join between the two tables and creates the `complete_table`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Capstone_Bike.complete_table` AS (
  SELECT 
    t1.ride_id,
    t1.rideable_type,
    t1.started_at,
    t1.ended_at,
    t1.member_casual,
    t2.start_station_name,
    t2.start_station_id,
    t2.end_station_name,
    t2.end_station_id,
    t2.start_lat,
    t2.start_lng,
    t2.end_lat,
    t2.end_lng,
    t2.member_casual AS t2_member_casual
  FROM `Capstone_Bike.combined_table` AS t1
  JOIN `Capstone_Bike.combined_table1` AS t2
  ON t1.ride_id = t2.ride_id
);
```
